# parent-pom

**parent-pom** is the parent pom for randomnoun maven projects

It specifies a handful of pom.xml elements common across java projects, including

* license
* organization
* developers
* distributionManagement
* reporting

And defines the version numbers for a raft of dependencies that I typically use in every project.
